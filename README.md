# A privacy-preserving machine learning algorithm using Rust




# A privacy-preserving machine learning algorithm using Python
This code uses the sklearn library to train a simple linear regression model on synthetic data. It then evaluates the model on the test set and prints the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to the console.

To make this algorithm privacy-preserving, you could use techniques such as federated learning or differential privacy. For example, instead of training the model on all of the data in a central location, you could use federated learning to train the model on each client's data separately and then combine the model updates in a privacy-preserving way. Alternatively, you could add noise to the model updates using differential privacy to ensure that the model updates do not reveal sensitive information about the training data.

Keep in mind that this is just an example and may not be production-ready code. You may need to handle errors more gracefully and add additional error checking and handling as needed for your specific use case.
